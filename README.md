2D PCS plot analyzer v3.2

The following code requires the numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and openpyxl module packages to run.
It is designed for 2d PCS plot visualization (using only axiality of magnetic susceptibility tensor).
When exporting to an Excel file, the file extension should be included. e.g.[filename.xlsx]

v1.1 updates
Excel export: x, y cartesian coordinates are calculated, and each column are separated by PCS values.

v.1.2 updates
-tensor values, PCS range, and intervals can now be input for calculations.
-molar susceptibility tensor calculation

...

v.3.2 updates
-XYZ file import and plot, coordinate rotation, atom coordinate table added, geometrical parameter analysis plot
